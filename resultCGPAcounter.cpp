/*
To calculate CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) with subjects having different credit hours, use the weighted average formula. Hereâ€™s the logic:

1. Multiply the grade points of each subject by its respective credit hours.
2. Sum up all the results from step 1.
3. Sum up all the credit hours.
4. Divide the total grade points by the total credit hours.
